# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

Provide Louis the insights of the Camapign project to understand how different campaigns have been fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.

### Purpose

This data analysis project provides Louis to understand the trend of outcomes of various compaigns that may be helpful for her to succeed in her Campaign project.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
    How the Outcomes have been turned out with respect to goals.All the goal amounts have been grouped to different buckets so that the outcomes can be derived with respect to the corresponding goal groups.
 	Please refer to the following link to see the chart where outcomes have been presented in terms of percentage for different goal groups.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
    How monthly data of theater category campaign outcomes have been shaped out interms of number of Passed, failed and successful outcomes based on campaign launch month.
    Please refer to the following link to see the chart of monthly snapshots of campaign outcomes based on launch date.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
    1. Figuring out the kind of chart to derived the insights properly
    2. Derive the conclusion on analysis

## Results
- 	Conclusions made out of Theater Outcomes by Launch Date
	      1. Maximum number of successful outcomes have been recorded for the Theater campaigns  launched during month of may.		 
		  2. Least campaigns cancelled in July.		 
		  3.Least campaigns failed in November.

- Conclusions made out of outcomes based on goal
	     1. Those campaigns who had lesser goal became more successful (Amount pedged was more than goal).		 
         2. None of the campaigns became successful for goal amount range 45000-49999 and all of them became failed. 

- Limitation of the dataset
    Few more insights provided below can not be derived from the available dataset:
	    1. The campaign outcomes of different category/sub-category over the years.
        2. The campaign analysis of different category/sub-category across different states of the country.

- Reccomendations for additional tables or graphs
	    1. Country wise success rates for each category through pie chart.			
		2. Monthly outcomes(Successful, failed and canceled) through stacked bar chart.
        3. Box and Whisker plot for find outliers for better analysis.
