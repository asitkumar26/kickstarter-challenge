# Overview of Project:

Analyze fund raising project of different campaigns to figure out how they have been fared 
in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.

# Analysis and Challenges:

Analysis has been done:

	- How the Outcomes have been turned out with respect to goals.All the goal amounts 
	  have been grouped to different buckets so that the outcomes can be derived with 
      respect to the corresponding goal groups.

 	  Please refer to the following link to see the chart where outcomes have been presented
	  in terms of percentage for different goal groups.

	- How monthly data of theater category campaign outcomes have been shaped out interms
    	of number of Passed, failed and successful outcomes based on campaign launch date.

      Please refer to the following link to see the chart of monthly snapshots of campaign 
	  outcomes based on launch date.

Challenges encountered are as follows:


# Results:	  
	 - 	Conclusions made out of Theater Outcomes by Launch Date
	      - Maximum number of successful outcomes have been recorded for the Theater campaigns 
		  launched during month of may.
		 
		  - Least campaigns cancelled in July
		 
		  - Least campaigns failed in November	 	 
	 
	 
	 - Conclusions made out of outcomes based on goal
	     - Those campaigns who had lesser goal became more successful (Amount pedged was more than goal).
		 
         - None of the campaigns became successful for goal amount range 45000-49999 and all of them became
           failed.  		 
	 
	 
	 - Limitation of the dataset
	 
	 
	 
	 - Reccomendations for additional tables or graphs
			- Country wise outcomes based on goal and launch date.
			
			- Subcategory wise outcomes based on goal and launch date.
